### Note
```
This wasn't created to replace vuex, you can only make use of this template for your small vue apps(that don't have that much data)
But for bigger apps with more data and functionality, Make sure to use Vuex. Because Vuex has a lot of specs to it that can help in 
Building those larger applications. So make sure to still practice using Vuex.
